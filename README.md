### Measure of Success
Build a robot arm that can draw a simple shape on paper with a writing implement. The base goal is for it to draw a simple shape that we program and an advanced iteration of the project is if we modified it to draw a shape based on some sort of input. It should function without breaking or stalling in any way; the measure of success is to have the robot arm draw a shape 5 times in a row without any difficulty.

### Potential Roadblocks and Solutions

Roadblock

Solution(s)

#### Time constraint (as of Feb. 12th, 2020)

Weekly check-ins with Dr. Shields

Built-in schedule modification in Week 3 


#### Absent partner or neither of us here

Schedule to work before/after school, BKT

Files backed up online in a shared file


#### Difficulty with coding/CAD designing

Ask surrounding students/Google solution

Ask Dr. Shields/another teacher


#### 3D printing/laser cutter problems

Confirm assembly with Dr. Shields before

Confirm parts reprint/re-cut parts if needed
